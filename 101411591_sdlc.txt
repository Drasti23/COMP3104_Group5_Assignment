Security has become an integral part of the software development lifecycle, with much of the security shifting left in the development process. DevSecOps ensures that DevOps teams understand the security and compliance requirements from the very beginning of application creation and can properly protect the integrity of the software.

By integrating security seamlessly into DevOps workflows, organizations gain the visibility and control necessary to meet complex security demands, including vulnerability reporting and auditing. Security teams can ensure that policies are being enforced throughout development and deployment, including critical testing phases.

DevSecOps can be implemented across an array of environments such as on-premises, cloud-native, and hybrid, ensuring maximum control over the entire software development lifecycle.

Key benefits: 
Adopting a DevOps culture brings numerous benefits to an organization, notably in operational efficiency, faster delivery of features, and improved product quality. Key advantages include:

Enhanced Collaboration: Breaking down silos between development and operations teams fosters a more cohesive working environment, leading to better communication and collaboration.

Increased Efficiency: Automation of the software development lifecycle reduces manual tasks, minimizes errors, and accelerates delivery times.
Continuous Improvement: DevOps encourages a culture of continuous feedback, allowing teams to quickly adapt and make improvements, ensuring that the software meets user needs effectively.

Higher Quality and Security: With practices like continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) and proactive security measures, DevOps ensures that the software is not only developed faster but also maintains high quality and security standards.

Faster Time to Market: By streamlining development processes and improving team collaboration, organizations can reduce the overall time from conception to deployment, offering a competitive edge in rapidly evolving markets.
The DevOps lifecycle and how DevOps works
The DevOps lifecyle stretches from the beginning of software development through to delivery, maintenance, and security. The stages of the DevOps lifecycle are:

Plan: Organize the work that needs to be done, prioritize it, and track its completion.

Create: Write, design, develop and securely manage code and project data with your team.

Verify: Ensure that your code works correctly and adheres to your quality standards â€” ideally with automated testing.

Package: Package your applications and dependencies, manage containers, and build artifacts.

Secure: Check for vulnerabilities through static and dynamic tests, fuzz testing, and dependency scanning.

Release: Deploy the software to end users.

Configure: Manage and configure the infrastructure required to support your applications.

Monitor: Track performance metrics and errors to help reduce the severity and frequency of incidents.

Govern: Manage security vulnerabilities, policies, and compliance across your organization.
