DevOps is important because it's a software development and operations approach that enables faster development of new products and easier maintenance of existing deployments.
DevOps adoption is growing rapidly. IDC forecasts the worldwide DevOps software market to reach $6.6 billion in 2022, up from $2.9 billion in 2017. The forces driving DevOps adoption include enterprise investments in software-driven innovation, adoption of microservices-based architectures and associated development methodologies, and increased investment by CTOs and CEOs in collaborative and automated application development and operational processes, says IDC analyst Stephen Elliot.
The late DevOps authority Robert Stroud said DevOps is all about "fueling business transformation" that encompasses people, process and culture change. The most effective strategies for DevOps transformation focus on structural improvements that build community. A successful DevOps initiative requires a culture—or mindset—change that brings greater collaboration between multiple teams—product, engineering, security, IT, operations and so on—as well as automation to better achieve business goals.

What kind of tangible benefits can DevOps bring? By managing engineering processes end to end, DevOps emphasizes deploying software more often, in a reliable and secure way through automation.
