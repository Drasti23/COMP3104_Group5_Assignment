DevOps is important because it's a software development and operations approach that enables faster development of new products and easier maintenance of existing deployments.
DevOps adoption is growing rapidly. IDC forecasts the worldwide DevOps software market to reach $6.6 billion in 2022, up from $2.9 billion in 2017. The forces driving DevOps adoption include enterprise investments in software-driven innovation, adoption of microservices-based architectures and associated development methodologies, and increased investment by CTOs and CEOs in collaborative and automated application development and operational processes, says IDC analyst Stephen Elliot.
