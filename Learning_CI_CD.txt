Information for CI/CD in Devops.

 CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (or Deployment).

 It is a set of practices in DevOps that automate and streamline the software development lifecycle. 

 Learning CI/CD is crucial because it promotes faster development cycles, reduces manual errors, ensures higher-quality software, and enables teams to respond quickly to changing requirements.
 
 Continuous Integration (CI) involves regularly merging code changes into a shared repository, where automated testing can immediately identify issues. 
 
 Continuous Delivery (CD) takes this further by ensuring that the code is always in a deployable state, allowing for frequent and reliable releases to production.
