## CI/CD Pipeline
This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. The CI workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` which automates the build and test processes on every push or pull request to the repository.

## Branching Strategy
Each member is required to work on their own branch, following the naming convention STUDENTID-Name. All changes must be reviewed and merged into the main branch via pull requests to ensure code quality and prevent conflicts.
